On of the first type of quantum computer to be built was the NMR quantum computer. It's a type of quantum computer that uses nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to manipulate qubits. The most common form of it being LSNMR (liquid state NMR).

Around the green tube, in which there is a solution (which is electrically neutral), we have a probe that emits radio waves. We then put some chosen molecule in the system, which will contain the qubits. The radio waves are absorbed by the nuclei of the atoms in the solution, which causes them to flip their spins. The spins of the nuclei are then manipulated to perform quantum operations.

We usually take very little of the molecule, so that we can have a good control over the qubits. The biggest advantage of such a system is that it does not need to be cooled to very low temperatures, as it is the case with other quantum computers. We have systems which can work at room temperature.

The problems however arise from the fact that even very little of them, are still a lot of atoms, which makes the system very noisy. The other problem is that when we put molecules into the system, they are much more likely to be in some random state than in nice clean ground states.
