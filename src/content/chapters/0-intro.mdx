I've done [a lot of things with quantum computers](https://github.com/kognise), but there's always been a gap in my knowledge: what exactly happens when you run a quantum program? Despite having most of the requisite low-level knowledge, I struggled to piece everything together. Are programs really executing directly on the QPU, or is something else happening? I've used quantum gates, but how do they *work*? What are they, really? How do multiple quantum programs run simultaneously?

I decided to figure it out. Comprehensive resources on quantum systems are rare if you're not in academia, so I had to sift through tons of different sources with varying quality and sometimes conflicting information. After a few weeks of research and almost 40 pages of notes, I have a much better understanding of how quantum computers work from startup to program execution. I wished I had one solid article explaining all this, so I'm writing the article I needed.
